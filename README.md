# BURGER STAND

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/makes-people-smile.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## Purpose

The purpose of the this application is to show the customers of <strong>BURGER STAND</strong> which burgers are available to order. It also shows popular burgers that have been ordered that day (and may or may not be available).

Because BURGER STAND is a customer friendly burger spot, we ask that our customors name their <em>own</em> burgers. BURGER STAND will add them to the menu so a new burger can be devoured by all of our hungry customers!
