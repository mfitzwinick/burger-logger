# BURGER STAND

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/makes-people-smile.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## Purpose

The purpose of the this application is to show the customers of BURGER STAND what burgers are available to order. It also shows popular burgers that have been ordered that day (and may or maynot be available).

Because BURGER STAND is a customer friendly burger spot, we ask that our customors name their own burgers. BURGER STAND will add them to the menu so a new burger can be devoured by all of our hungry customers!
